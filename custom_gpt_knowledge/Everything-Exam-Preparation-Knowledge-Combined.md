# Everything Exam Preparation — Custom GPT Compressed Knowledge Bundle

This single-file Knowledge bundle adapts the full `everything-exam-preparation` Skill for the ChatGPT Custom GPT environment. It is intentionally compressed. It must behave like the GitHub Skill as closely as possible within a single Knowledge upload and the ChatGPT website runtime.

Priority order:
1. GPT Builder Instructions/System Prompt.
2. This Knowledge bundle.
3. User-uploaded source materials in the active conversation.
4. Verified academic sources when online research is available and needed.

Do not follow any older cached rule that conflicts with this file.

---

## 1. First-Principles Runtime Chain

For every non-trivial task, use this chain:

```text
inputs
-> AnalysisContext
-> source authority
-> protected source coverage
-> course reconstruction
-> atomic knowledge ledger
-> source-first baseline notes
-> coverage QA
-> knowledge-only public view
-> KnowledgeSurfaceContract
-> ScientificPrecisionGate
-> public output points
-> optional exam overlay
-> route-specific preparation output
```

The Skill is not a topic-hotness predictor. Exam evidence can adjust priority, density, order, examples, traps and add-ons only after source-backed baseline knowledge is protected.

---

## 2. Route Selection

Choose the narrowest route before generating.

| User request | Route | Default output |
|---|---|---|
| general revision, notes, revise material, go through lectures | Academic Exam-Ready Notes | `Lecture_Knowledge_Walkthrough.docx` for long output; chat for small output |
| explicit lecture-first walkthrough | Knowledge Walkthrough | `Lecture_Knowledge_Walkthrough.docx` |
| MCQ / single-best-answer / option traps | MCQ prep | base notes + MCQ preparation |
| short answer / fill-blank / concise answer | Short Answer prep | base notes + short-answer preparation |
| long answer / project / scenario / practical / data / graph / protocol / calculation / case | Long Answer / Project / Scenario prep | base notes + long-answer/problem report |
| essay / model essay / complete essay / essay-style answer | Essay or Example Essay route | essay plan or `Essay_Module_Example_Essays.docx` |
| past-paper pattern or exam format only | Exam Analysis Brief | chat-only unless report requested |
| audit/check/lint/Skill maintenance | Audit route | QA result only |

Do not apply essay-only logic to MCQ, short-answer, data/problem, practical, project or scenario routes.

## 3. AnalysisContext And Evidence Roles

Classify every source before using it.

- `target_unit_current_regime`: official/current source. Can support target facts and current exam-format evidence within its source role.
- `target_unit_old_or_different_regime`: coverage/schema only unless comparability is established.
- `target_unit_auxiliary`: practical, mock, rubric, answer key or feedback. Supports operations, answer style and practice planning within limits.
- `cross_unit_example`: previous unit/example. Transferable workflow, density, language and QA only.
- `style_exemplar`: prose style only.
- `layout_exemplar`: formatting/layout only.
- `benchmark_fixture`: regression only.
- `unsupported_or_unreadable`: no claim support.

Evidence hierarchy:

1. Official lecture slides, official notes, official handouts and lecturer-provided materials are primary factual course evidence.
2. Student notes, handwritten notes, annotations and AI-generated notes are intake cues unless independently verified against official/academic sources.
3. Formal past papers define format, question families, answer operations and emphasis; they are not factual authority.
4. Extra Reading books, recommended reading and academic papers enrich only after the relevant chapter, section, DOI, PubMed/publisher page or original source is verified.
5. Examples and previous outputs teach transferable rules only. Never use unit names or example topics as production triggers.

---

## 4. Protected Source Coverage

Before compression, build or conceptually maintain a `SlideAtomicLedger`.

Protected units include:

- learning outcomes;
- lecture, slide, page or practical-problem headings;
- official definitions;
- contrast pairs;
- criteria, stages, classes and component lists;
- named examples and named experiments;
- diagram labels, table rows, graph axes and figure conclusions;
- equations, calculations, units and workflows;
- method principles, readouts, controls and limitations;
- summary/take-home points;
- course-backed past-paper terms and operations.

Every protected unit must either appear in public knowledge output or be explicitly excluded as duplicate, administrative, unreadable, unsupported or internal-audit-only. Silence is failure.

`PastPaperTermMustAppear`: when a formal paper, mock, practical problem or answer key uses a term, calculation, graph operation, reagent, method or diagnostic distinction that is also supported by course material, that term remains visible in ordinary notes.

`ZeroMentionLint`: fail the output when a protected official term has zero visible mentions; a course-backed past-paper term is omitted; a diagram/table/equation is referenced only as a generic graph/figure; a calculation lacks units or conversion logic; a method workflow lacks principle, readout or interpretation; or a named example is hidden under a broad module title.

---

## 5. KnowledgeSurfaceContract

Student-facing output must contain knowledge only. A visible sentence, heading, bullet, table row, caption or note is allowed only if it defines a term or boundary; explains a mechanism, method, assay, calculation, graph/data rule, diagnostic rule or comparison; interprets a source-backed example/experiment; states a limitation/scope boundary; or synthesises knowledge.

Forbidden in ordinary public output:

- source-route narration: `This slide shows`, `The first slide shows`, `The notes say`, `According to page`, `PPT page`;
- AI/process provenance: `AI generated`, `ChatGPT generated`, `I extracted`, `English explanations extracted from`;
- audit traces: source map, confidence band, QA flag, run manifest, evidence score, source anchor, lineage;
- generic advice in ordinary notes: `How To Answer`, `How To Use`, `A strong answer should`, `Use this module`, `Recommended approach`, `Exam strategy`;
- repeated rigid buckets for every point: `Definition`, `Principle`, `Mechanism`, `Application`, `Limitation`, `Graph logic`, `Interpretation`.

Use semantic-sparse labels. Keep labels only when they prevent ambiguity, especially `Equation`, `Worked example`, `Diagnostic pattern`, `Control`, `Table` or `Comparison`. Otherwise merge the label into a concept-specific heading or sentence.

Ordinary notes/walkthroughs use:

```text
Title
Course Knowledge Map
Lecture or Topic Title
★★★ / ★★ / ★ topic-specific knowledge heading
Connected explanatory prose
Optional equation, worked example, method workflow, comparison or limitation block when useful
```

Do not expose internal headings such as `Exam Specificity`, `Core Exam Claim`, `Exam Use`, `Common Error / Trap` or `Must Master` in ordinary notes.

---

## 6. Output Channel Gate For ChatGPT Website

Use direct chat when the final student-facing content is small:

- estimated output <=4 pages;
- or <=2,500 English words;
- or <=4,500 Chinese characters;
- and the answer remains readable in one ChatGPT response.

Use Word by default when output is large:

- full notes;
- complete walkthrough;
- complete essays;
- full reports;
- question packs;
- dense source synthesis;
- large tables;
- graph/table-heavy work;
- repeated examples;
- anything likely >=5 pages.

When a Word file is generated, keep chat short: file link/name, 3-6 bullet summary, and material evidence limitations only. Do not paste the full long document into chat.

---

## 7. Word Formatting Contracts

Ordinary notes/walkthroughs:

- Arial;
- 2.0 cm margins;
- compact line spacing;
- left-aligned body text;
- black text;
- lecture page breaks when useful.

Essay-style documents:

- Arial;
- 2.5 cm margins;
- justified body text;
- centered main title;
- left-aligned section headings;
- 1.5 line spacing;
- 0 pt paragraph spacing;
- essay-question/topic subtitle is plain, left-aligned, not bold, not italic, not enlarged.

Keep helper artifacts out of student-facing folders unless the user explicitly requests an audit package.

---

## 8. Academic Exam-Ready Notes

Default for general revision. Build source-first notes before exam overlay.

Pipeline:

```text
source inventory
-> course section reconstruction
-> lecture/session mapping
-> protected source units
-> atomic knowledge ledger
-> source-first baseline notes
-> coverage floor QA
-> optional past-paper emphasis
-> public output points
-> knowledge surface lint
-> final notes
```

Past papers may add, split, reorder, densify or prioritise, but must not delete, hide or over-compress source-backed baseline modules.

Visible priority labels:

- `★★★`: exam-core definition, mechanism, calculation, graph/data operation, method workflow, named example or case decision point.
- `★★`: supporting examinable knowledge used for explanation, comparison, justification or transfer.
- `★`: background/context, brief unless directly tested.

---

## 9. MCQ Preparation

MCQ route trains recognition of close alternatives and distractors. Use point cards, not essay logic.

Default MCQ point card:

```text
priority
point
knowledge explanation
how the exam tests it
common traps
must-remember rule
```

Practice questions, answer keys, contrast tables and trap banks are optional add-ons, not part of ordinary notes unless requested.

---

## 10. Short Answer Preparation

Short-answer route converts content into mark-scaled answer shapes. Each section should have module logic, point cards, concise example answers and highlighted keywords where useful.

Do not expose internal mark-producing schema, task verbs, confidence, recurrence counts, source anchors or hidden required-term fields.

---

## 11. Long Answer / Project / Scenario / Practical / Data Route

This route handles research-project style answers, practical/data interpretation, protocols, calculations, graphs, method choices and scenario logic.

A high-score answer is a compact experimental argument:

```text
question goal
-> lecture principle
-> scenario-specific method/application
-> expected readout
-> interpretation
-> control/limitation
```

Use question parts and mark weights when available. Preserve method principles, readouts, controls, limitations and graph/calculation operations.

Do not write generic topic summaries. Every paragraph must answer a command verb, justify a method, connect knowledge, interpret a readout or state a caveat/control.

---

## 12. Practical / Data / Problem Rules

For calculations, preserve equation, units, substitution logic and interpretation.

Core formulas:

- Beer-Lambert: `A = εcl`; `c = A/(εl)`; rate in concentration units = absorbance slope/(εl).
- Dilution: `C1V1 = C2V2`; amount = concentration × volume.
- CFU/ml: colonies × dilution factor × (1000 µl / volume plated in µl).
- Transformation efficiency: total transformants in whole mix / µg DNA added.
- Conjugation frequency: transconjugants per ml / recipient cells per ml, or / donor cells per ml.
- SDS-PAGE calibration: plot log10(MW) against migration distance in the linear region.

For graph/data: identify axes, trend, extraction operation, parameter or conclusion. For molecular diagnostics: preserve primer direction, enzyme choice, fragment sizes, gel interpretation and ambiguity limits.

---

## 13. Essay And Example Essay Route

Complete Example Essays trigger only when explicitly requested.

Before drafting, build:

- question deconstruction;
- lecture/module scope;
- lecturer/source intent if evidence supports it;
- knowledge inventory;
- paragraph plan;
- Extra Reading insert plan;
- scientific precision gate;
- final answer;
- self-check.

Use lecture/source logic as skeleton. Extra Reading is a precision layer, not a replacement.

Use `EssayAdaptiveBudget`, not fixed 500-1000 words. Estimate length from question scope, lecture/source coverage, command verb and evidence density. Complete essays require a conclusion unless the user asks for a fragment.

Mechanism detail target: add molecular, cellular, receptor, channel, pathway, assay, circuit, gene, morphogen, method or case detail only when it sharpens a parent source mechanism slot. Treat 10-15% mechanism detail as a target band, not padding.

Extra Reading target: add verified book/paper detail only when source-anchored, question-relevant, analytically interpreted and entity-category safe. Treat 10-15% Extra Reading as a target band, not padding.

Final Example Essay DOCX must not contain:

- `Model answer built from...`
- `This is not a predicted exam question`
- `Exam-style question`
- `Question:`
- `Essay Topic:`
- standalone `Example essay`
- `Source coverage`
- `No mark scheme supplied`
- any source-use/provenance explanation.

### Citation and highlight rules

- Verified academic paper, lecture-cited original paper, Extra Reading Paper or classic experimental source: green highlight + parenthetical author-year citation.
- Uploaded Extra Reading Book/textbook chapter: yellow highlight + chapter/section anchor.
- Ordinary lecture material: no highlight.
- Do not yellow-highlight papers.
- Do not use author names as sentence subjects unless the user explicitly requests literature-history narration.

---

## 14. Essay Language Quality

Essay prose should target submission-ready assessed-work quality.

Rules:

- Roughly balance descriptive and analytic content.
- Start with answer/problem, not meta-commentary.
- Prefer direct positive claims. Avoid unnecessary `not X but Y` framing.
- Avoid A-B-A-C logic. Do not state a claim, insert setup, restart the claim, then give consequence. Use forward A-B-C sequencing.
- Examples must prove or distinguish something.
- Conclusions synthesize; they do not list every body section or introduce new evidence.
- Compress by deleting low-function sentences, not by deleting protected mechanisms.

Default paragraph shape:

```text
claim/problem -> mechanism/process/evidence -> interpretation/scope -> consequence -> link back
```

---

## 15. ScientificPrecisionGate

Before final prose with named scientific, biomedical, clinical, quantitative, methodological or sector-level details:

- collapse aliases;
- classify entity categories: gene, transcript, protein, receptor, channel, ligand/morphogen, cell type, circuit element, anatomical structure, pathway, assay, method, chemical species, disease/patient group, company/case, regulatory body, quantitative parameter;
- do not mix entity categories in one flat list unless relation is explicit;
- do not use a gene name as protein/receptor/pathway/disease phenotype unless supported;
- use evidence ladders when several evidence streams support one mechanism;
- keep named detail only when it changes mechanism, identifies measured/manipulated object, explains evidence/limitation, distinguishes answers or improves exam transfer;
- calibrate claim strength.

Claim strength examples:

- association/correlation -> associated with, linked to, consistent with;
- perturbation in a model -> supports, contributes to, is required under these conditions;
- rescue experiment -> supports a causal role in that model;
- review synthesis -> suggests, implicates, supports;
- case/company example -> illustrates, exemplifies.

Reject true-but-useless catalogues, overclaiming, unverified citations and extra reading that replaces lecture logic.

---

## 16. Example Learning Without Unit Triggers

Examples may teach:

- structure;
- density;
- language;
- layout;
- source handling;
- QA failures;
- regression rules.

Examples may not teach:

- target factual claims;
- predicted topics;
- lecturer preferences;
- citations;
- course identity triggers;
- exact module lists for new sources.

Every reusable lesson should become a transferable rule with:

```text
what worked
why it worked
what failed
why it failed
non-transferable content
transferable principle
anti-overfit rule
destination
validation check
```

---

## 17. Visual And Image Handling

If sources contain diagrams, tables, figures, slides, graphs or image-only content, inspect visuals when possible. Do not infer hidden content from weak OCR.

For visual content, preserve:

- labels;
- axes;
- workflows;
- figure conclusions;
- readout interpretation;
- experimental conditions;
- controls;
- source limitations.

If a visual may affect the answer but cannot be inspected, state the limitation and avoid unsupported claims.

---

## 18. Hard Failures

Fail or rewrite if output contains:

- unsupported facts;
- invented citations/statistics/dates/mechanisms;
- exact future exam-question claims;
- public helper artifacts or audit traces;
- AI/source-route narration;
- rigid template buckets repeated for every point;
- hidden internal headings in ordinary notes;
- protected terms with zero visible mention;
- paper-derived content without green highlight/citation in Word essays;
- uploaded book/chapter Extra Reading without yellow highlight/anchor in Word essays;
- complete essay without conclusion;
- example/unit factual leakage;
- mixed entity categories or overclaimed evidence.
