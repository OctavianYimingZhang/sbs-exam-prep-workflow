# Student-Facing Output Policy

The Skill may use source anchors, evidence claims, confidence bands, examiner-operation labels, recurrence, lecture centrality, scoring logic, and source coverage internally. Student-facing outputs must not expose that audit reasoning unless the user explicitly asks for an audit package.

Student-facing exam-prep outputs must be rewritten as directly usable revision content:

```text
internal reasoning: evidence -> operation -> priority -> output type
student output: priority -> public point -> explanation -> knowledge-bearing blocks
```

Ordinary Academic Exam-Ready Notes are knowledge documents, not exam-format audits. They must not display assessment percentages, exam timing, mark splits, Section A/Section B administrative rules, historical-paper comparability notes, `Coverage note` warnings, source-quality caveats, ELM-check warnings, or provenance/audit explanations. Keep those items internal unless the user explicitly requests an audit package.

## Forbidden Visible Fields

Do not show these fields in ordinary student-facing reports:

- source anchor;
- evidence rationale;
- confidence;
- recurrence count;
- lecture centrality;
- regime match;
- why high-yield;
- examiner operation;
- discriminator axis;
- task verb;
- reference expansion;
- common omissions;
- evidence limit;
- past-paper year mapping;
- prediction score.
- assessment timing;
- mark split;
- current regime;
- older papers;
- no mark scheme;
- coverage note;
- source coverage;
- extraction quality;

Canonical forbidden field IDs:

```text
source_anchor
confidence
evidence
examiner_operation
discriminator_axis
practice_mcq
answer_key
contrast_table
separate_trap_bank
mark_producing_schema
reference_expansion
exam_specificity
core_exam_claim
exam_use
common_error_or_trap
must_master
```

These may appear only in internal QA or an explicit audit package requested by the user.

## Allowed Priority Labels

Use only these visible priority labels when priority is useful:

- `★★★`;
- `★★`;
- `★`.

Meanings:

- `★★★` = answer-producing exam core: standalone definition, mechanism, calculation, graph/data operation, criteria list, method workflow, named source example, or case-study decision point.
- `★★` = supporting examinable knowledge: useful for explanation, comparison, justification, or transfer.
- `★` = background/context: useful framing only; keep brief unless directly tested.

Do not explain why a point is `★★★` by exposing recurrence, confidence, or source-scoring logic. Convert the reason into useful content: what to know, which mechanism or list matters, and which boundary or limitation prevents an error.

## Exam Prep Notes Student Contract

`exam_prep_notes_docx` is the default general-revision route. It emits Academic Exam-Ready Notes in the compatible public artifact `Lecture_Knowledge_Walkthrough.docx`.

Visible structure:

```yaml
ExamPrepNotesStudentContract:
  course_knowledge_map: string
  lecture_mapping: list[string]
  exam_ready_knowledge_notes: list[PublicOutputPoint]
  question_type_addons: list[QuestionTypeAddOn]
  optional_visual_aids: list[GeneratedVisualAidCaption]
```

The visible top matter is `Course Knowledge Map`, not `Course-Level Exam Map`. It may state how the knowledge is organised, list knowledge sections, and map lectures/topics to those sections. Generic exam advice stays internal unless the user asks for a question-type add-on.

Compact Public Notes Rule:

- Internally, decompose sources into atomic knowledge items and protect every source-backed definition, criterion, mechanism, method, example, equation, graph, table, and workflow.
- Publicly, render compact lecture-level exam notes. Do not expose the internal card scaffold.
- Each lecture starts on a new page.
- Group protected atomic items into readable public points using concise paragraphs, bullets, equations, examples, comparisons, and mechanism chains.
- Coverage must be complete; formatting must be compact.

Visible public point:

```yaml
PublicOutputPoint:
  point_id: string
  lecture_session_id: string
  point_title: string
  priority: ★★★ | ★★ | ★
  point_kind: definition | mechanism | method_workflow | criteria_list | comparison | calculation | graph_or_data_interpretation | canonical_example | compact_background
  main_text: string
  blocks: list[PublicPointBlock]
  covered_atomic_units: list[string]

PublicPointBlock:
  block_type: definitions | key_points | criteria | steps | mechanism | equation | calculation_logic | graph_logic | comparison | example | limitation
  label: string | null
  content: string | list[string]
```

Internal card fields guide planning and QA. They are not public headings. Ordinary Academic Exam-Ready Notes must not render headings named `Exam Specificity`, `Core Exam Claim`, `Exam Use`, `Common Error / Trap`, or `Must Master`. `Canonical Example` remains an internal planning field; public notes should render the knowledge as an `Example` block, localized equivalent, or unlabeled paragraph.

`Exam Use`, `Common Error / Trap`, and `Must Master` may appear only in MCQ reports, short-answer add-ons, explicit trap/checklist outputs, or internal QA. In ordinary notes, useful distinctions should be integrated into `comparison`, `limitation`, or the main explanation.

Allowed visible add-on items:

- testable statement;
- possible wrong or distractor statement;
- common trap;
- must-remember rule;
- bounded example question;
- concise example answer;
- required terms bolded inside answer text;
- `Avoid this mistake`;
- essay-ready paragraph block;
- generated schematic caption.

Question-type add-ons must come after the base notes. They do not replace the base notes and must not expose source anchors, recurrence, confidence, internal scoring, or past-paper year mapping.

## MCQ Student Contract

MCQ reports are point-card reports. They must not contain practice questions, answer keys, contrast tables, or a separate trap bank by default.

Visible MCQ Point Card:

```yaml
MCQStudentPointCard:
  priority: ★★★ | ★★ | ★
  point: string
  knowledge_explanation: string
  how_exam_tests_it: string
  common_traps: list[string]
  must_remember: string
```

Forbidden by default:

- practice MCQ;
- answer key;
- contrast table;
- separate trap bank;
- source anchor;
- confidence;
- evidence;
- examiner operation;
- discriminator axis.

If the user explicitly asks for practice questions, generate a separate practice pack rather than adding them into the MCQ high-yield report.

## Short-Answer Student Contract

Short-answer reports have two levels:

- module-level logic, so the student understands how related points connect;
- point-level cards, so the student can write a direct answer.

Visible module section:

```yaml
ShortAnswerModuleSection:
  module_name: string
  module_core_logic: string
  high_yield_points: list[string]
  point_cards: list[ShortAnswerPointCard]
```

Visible point card:

```yaml
ShortAnswerPointCard:
  priority: ★★★ | ★★ | ★
  point: string
  common_question_form: string
  exam_explanation_with_highlighted_keywords: string
  example_answer: string
```

Do not display these as separate fields:

- mark-producing schema;
- required terms;
- optional examples;
- reference expansion;
- common omissions;
- task verb;
- confidence;
- source anchor.

Required terms should be bolded inside the explanation. Mark logic should be absorbed into the `Example Answer` as a natural paragraph, not exposed as a scoring table. Do not split the student answer mechanically into 2/4/6/8-mark versions unless the user specifically asks for that format.

## Long-Answer Student Contract

Long-answer outputs are exam-response playbooks, not general study coaching.

Visible structure:

```yaml
LongAnswerStudentItem:
  topic: string
  core_exam_problem: string
  likely_question_forms: list[string]
  answer_order: list[string]
  reusable_answer_blocks:
    mechanism_block: string
    method_or_readout_block: string
    interpretation_block: string
    control_or_limitation_block: string
  example_answer: string
  adaptation_rules: list[string]
  must_include: list[string]
  avoid_overwriting: list[string]
```

Do not show evidence, source, confidence, recurrence, or why the operation is likely.

## Essay Student Contract

Essay outputs are module-level packs only when the user explicitly asks for essay preparation or complete Example Essays.

Visible structure:

```yaml
EssayModulePack:
  module_name: string
  essay_title: string
  core_thesis: string
  full_example_essay: string
  adaptation_map: list[string]
  key_paragraph_bank: list[string]
  essential_terms: list[string]
  likely_stem_variants: list[string]
```

The useful student-facing pair is:

```text
Full Example Essay + how to adapt it to specific essay questions
```

Do not generate Essay Module Packs as the default revision product.

## Visual Aid Student Boundary

Generated visual aids may be embedded or attached only as revision schematics. The visible caption must state that the image is generated for revision and is not an official course figure.

Do not use a generated image as evidence, a citation, an official answer, or a replacement for written explanation. If the platform cannot generate images, omit the visual-aid section from the student-facing output.
